# Porter-Duff

An idle hands project to rewrite the classic [Porter-Duff](http://keithp.com/~keithp/porterduff/p253-porter.pdf) compositing paper in Markdown with embedded TeX for the maths.

Edit using whatever you want: [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) seems to cope. Then `make all` to build HTML and PDF versions once [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) and XeLaTeX dependencies are available.

[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/) was used to create the SVG format diagrams.

## TODO

* The 'point reyes' images need to be extracted from the original PDF and imported.
* The SVGs won't convert into PDF via pandoc/latex.
